          <div class="face back">
              <p>Psychologists help a wide variety of patients and can treat numerous types of problems. Some people consult a psychologist because they have been feeling depressed, angry, or anxious for a long time. Others want help with a chronic disorder that interferes with their lives or physical health. Still, others turn to a psychologist because they are experiencing short-term problems that they want to resolve, such as feeling overwhelmed by a new job or being affected by the death of a family member. Psychologists also help us to cope with stressful situations, heal from addictions, manage chronic illnesses and remove obstacles that prevent us from achieving our goals. </p>
